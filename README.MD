## 🌐 Battle-Tested During a Total Internet Blackout

MasterDnsVPN isn't just a theoretical project. It is battle-tested and proven to work in environments where the global internet is completely severed.

Recently, during the 88-day internet blackout in Iran, authorities didn't just block VPNs or filter websites—they completely pulled the plug on international bandwidth. With 99% of the connection to the outside world physically cut off, users were trapped inside a closed, local intranet. 

Standard circumvention tools are useless when there is no international internet to connect to. Yet, during this massive shutdown, MasterDnsVPN stood out as one of the very few lifelines that actually kept users connected to the global web.

**How did it survive a total shutdown?**
Instead of acting like a standard VPN, MasterDnsVPN relies on smart DNS tunneling techniques to pierce through the blackout:
* **Multiple Resolvers:** It routes traffic through various DNS resolvers, ensuring the connection never relies on a single, easily blockable path.
* **Encryption & Data Splitting:** It encrypts your data and breaks it down into tiny, scattered pieces.
* **Disguised as Legitimate Traffic:** It wraps these data pieces inside standard, perfectly normal DNS queries.
* **Bypassing Local Traps:** Because the traffic looks exactly like basic, everyday DNS requests, firewalls allow it through. The data gets resolved and reaches the outside world—even if the network forces you to use their own restricted, government-controlled local resolvers.

This exact combination is what allowed MasterDnsVPN to maintain a stable connection when the outside world was completely blocked.

# Setup and Getting Started 🧑‍💻

## Section 1: 🖥️ Server Setup

### Section 1.1: 🌐 Domain Setup and Preparation (Prerequisite)

To receive DNS requests directly on your server, you must delegate a subdomain to it. In short, create two records: one `A` record that points to your server IP, and one `NS` record that delegates the tunnel subdomain to that A record.

#### Step 1.1.1: 🅰️ Create an A Record (Server Address)

- **Type:** `A`
- **Name:** a short name such as `ns`
- **Value:** your server IPv4 address

> Example: `ns.example.com -> 1.2.3.4`

> Cloudflare note: if the domain uses Cloudflare, open the `DNS` page and click the cloud icon next to the `A` record so it becomes gray (`DNS only`). It must not remain proxied.

#### Step 1.1.2: 🏷️ Create an NS Record (Delegate the Subdomain)

- **Type:** `NS`
- **Name:** the tunnel subdomain, for example `v`
- **Value / Target:** `ns.example.com`

> Example: `v.example.com -> ns.example.com`

> Cloudflare note: add the `NS` record normally. Cloudflare does not proxy NS records, but make sure the `ns` A record is already set to `DNS only`.

#### Section 1.1.3: 💡 A Short Note About MTU

Shorter domain names leave more space for actual data inside each DNS request. For better throughput, keep names short. If you use Cloudflare, still keep the relevant records in `DNS only` mode.

---

### Section 1.2: 🐧 Quick Linux Server Installation

#### Step 1.2.1: Automatic Installation (Script)

If you want to deploy the server on Linux, the easiest method is the automatic installer script. Run this command on the server:

```bash
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/masterking32/MasterDnsVPN/main/server_linux_install.sh)
```

The script handles installation and configuration automatically. When it finishes, the server starts and the **encryption key** is shown in the terminal log and also written to `encrypt_key.txt` next to the executable. Keep this key safe.

#### Step 1.2.2: Important Notes After Installation

- During installation, you will be asked for a domain. It must be the same delegated subdomain you configured in the `NS` record, for example `v.example.com`.
- After creating DNS records, wait for propagation. This may take from a few minutes to several hours, and in some cases up to 48 hours depending on TTL and the DNS provider.
- To verify the DNS setup, you can use tools such as `dig` or `nslookup`, for example `dig v.example.com NS` or `nslookup -type=ns v.example.com`. For a direct query to the new nameserver: `dig @ns.example.com v.example.com A`.
- If the server firewall is enabled, allow UDP port 53. Example for `ufw`:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 53/udp
sudo ufw reload
```

For `firewalld`:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=53/udp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

- If port `53` is already occupied by another service, such as `systemd-resolved`, see the troubleshooting section “Fixing Port 53 Already in Use”.
- The encryption key (`encrypt_key.txt`) is shown after installation. Copy it and store it safely because the client needs it to connect.

## Section 3.4: 📘 Client Configuration Variables (`client_config.toml`)

### 3.4.1) 🧭 Tunnel Identity and Security

| Parameter | Sample Value | Allowed Values / Real Behavior | Full Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `PROTOCOL_TYPE` | `"SOCKS5"` | `"SOCKS5"` or `"TCP"` | Chooses the local service mode exposed by the client.<br>`SOCKS5` is the default and recommended mode for normal use.<br>`TCP` is useful when you want to forward traffic to one fixed remote target instead of giving applications a SOCKS proxy. |
| `DOMAINS` | `["v.example.com"]` | Non-empty list of strings | These are the tunnel domains used to build DNS requests.<br>Every domain here must belong to the same tunnel you configured on the server.<br>If this list is wrong, the client may build valid DNS queries that the server will simply ignore. |
| `DATA_ENCRYPTION_METHOD` | `1` | `0..5` | Must match the server.<br>`0=None`, `1=XOR`, `2=ChaCha20`, `3=AES-128-GCM`, `4=AES-192-GCM`, `5=AES-256-GCM`.<br>XOR is lightweight but weaker. AEAD modes are stronger but have more overhead. |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | `""` | String | Shared secret used by the client codec.<br>This must be exactly the same as the server-side encryption key.<br>If the key is wrong, packets may be parsed as garbage and the tunnel will not work. |

### 3.4.2) 🧦 Local Proxy

| Parameter | Sample Value | Allowed Values / Real Behavior | Full Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `LISTEN_IP` | `"127.0.0.1"` | Valid IP string | Address where the client listens for local proxy users.<br>Use `127.0.0.1` for normal local-only usage.<br>If some applications prefer IPv6 localhost on your system, using `localhost` can be a better local-only choice.<br>Use `0.0.0.0` only if you want to share the proxy on the network and understand the security implications. |
| `LISTEN_PORT` | `18000` | `0..65535` | Port for the local proxy.<br>Your applications must use this port to send traffic into the tunnel. |
| `SOCKS5_AUTH` | `false` | `true/false` | Enables username/password authentication on the local SOCKS5 proxy.<br>If you bind to `0.0.0.0`, enabling this is strongly recommended. |
| `SOCKS5_USER` | `"master_dns_vpn"` | Up to 255 bytes | Username for the local SOCKS5 proxy.<br>Used only if `SOCKS5_AUTH=true`. |
| `SOCKS5_PASS` | `"master_dns_vpn"` | Up to 255 bytes | Password for the local SOCKS5 proxy.<br>Used only if `SOCKS5_AUTH=true`. |

### 3.4.3) 📛 Local DNS

| Parameter | Sample Value | Allowed Values / Real Behavior | Full Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `LOCAL_DNS_ENABLED` | `false` | `true/false` | If enabled, the client exposes a local DNS service and can resolve DNS through the tunnel.<br>This is useful for reducing DNS hijacking or when you want applications to use the tunnel for DNS as well. |
| `LOCAL_DNS_IP` | `"127.0.0.1"` | Valid IP string | Bind address for the local DNS listener. |
| `LOCAL_DNS_PORT` | `53` | `0..65535` | Port of the local DNS service.<br>Port `53` is standard, but on some systems it may already be used by another service. |
| `LOCAL_DNS_CACHE_MAX_RECORDS` | `5000` | If `<1`, fallback applies | Maximum number of local DNS cache records.<br>A larger value reduces repeated DNS lookups but uses more memory. |
| `LOCAL_DNS_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` | `28800.0` | If `<=0`, fallback applies | How long successful DNS records stay in the local cache. |
| `LOCAL_DNS_PENDING_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `300.0` | If `<=0`, fallback applies | If a local DNS query is in progress, follower queries can wait for it instead of launching another upstream request.<br>This value defines how long they may wait. |
| `LOCAL_DNS_CACHE_PERSIST_TO_FILE` | `true` | `true/false` | If enabled, the local DNS cache can be written to disk for reuse between runs. |
| `LOCAL_DNS_CACHE_FLUSH_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `60.0` | If `<=0`, fallback applies | How often the persisted local DNS cache is flushed to disk. |

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `RESOLVER_BALANCING_STRATEGY` | `2` | `0..8` | Chooses how resolvers are selected.<br>`0/2` = Round Robin, `1` = Random, `3` = Least Loss, `4` = Lowest Latency, `5` = Hybrid Score, `6` = Loss Then Latency, `7` = Least Loss Top Random, `8` = Least Loss Top Round Robin.<br>The hybrid mode uses a weighted combined score. The loss-then-latency mode first shortlists by loss, then prefers lower latency inside that tier, and rotates among near-equal top candidates. The top-random mode picks randomly from the best loss tier so load does not stick to one resolver. The top-round-robin mode cycles through the same top loss tier with deterministic rotation. |
| `PACKET_DUPLICATION_COUNT` | `2` | clamp to valid range in code | Normal outgoing packet duplication count.<br>Higher values increase traffic cost but improve survivability on weak links. |

| `STREAM_RESOLVER_FAILOVER_RESEND_THRESHOLD` | `2` | If `<1`, fallback applies | If a stream accumulates repeated resend pressure on the same preferred resolver, the client may fail over that stream to another resolver.<br>This threshold controls how quickly that happens. |
| `STREAM_RESOLVER_FAILOVER_COOLDOWN` | `2.5` | If `<=0`, fallback applies | Minimum delay between two failovers for the same stream.<br>This prevents unstable oscillation between resolvers. |
| `RECHECK_INACTIVE_SERVERS_ENABLED` | `true` | `true/false` | Enables background rechecks for currently disabled or unhealthy resolvers.<br>If disabled, once a resolver becomes unusable, it will stay disabled until restart or manual rebuild. |
| `AUTO_DISABLE_TIMEOUT_SERVERS` | `true` | `true/false` | Enables automatic disabling of resolvers that keep timing out and show no successful activity. |
| `AUTO_DISABLE_TIMEOUT_WINDOW_SECONDS` | `30.0` | If `<=0`, fallback applies | Time window used to decide whether a resolver is timeout-only.<br>If all observations in this window are timeouts, it may be disabled. |
| `BASE_ENCODE_DATA` | `false` | `true/false` | If enabled, payloads are encoded in a base-safe format before tunneling.<br>This usually reduces payload efficiency, but can help in strict resolver environments. |

## Section 3.5: 📖 Server Configuration (`server_config.toml`)

> ℹ️ Note: the sample server config contains a key named `CONFIG_VERSION`, but the current Go code does not read it into `ServerConfig`. For that reason it is not included in the table below and has no effect on real server behavior.

### 3.5.1) 🌐 Tunnel Policy and Protocol Acceptance

| Parameter | Sample Value in `server_config.toml.simple` | Allowed Values / Real Behavior | Full Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `DOMAIN` | `["v.domain.com"]` | list of strings | Domain or domains that this server treats as belonging to its tunnel.<br>They must match the client `DOMAINS`, otherwise tunnel packets will not be recognized correctly. |
| `PROTOCOL_TYPE` | `"SOCKS5"` | only `"SOCKS5"` or `"TCP"` | Determines what kind of setup the server accepts for new streams.<br>In `SOCKS5` mode, the server expects `PACKET_SOCKS5_SYN` and takes the target from the client payload.<br>In `TCP` mode, setup happens through `PACKET_STREAM_SYN` and the server connects to `FORWARD_IP:FORWARD_PORT`. |
| `MIN_VPN_LABEL_LENGTH` | not shown in sample | if `<=0`, fallback to `3` | Minimum tunnel data label length.<br>This helps avoid confusing ordinary DNS queries with tunnel queries.<br>If this parameter is missing from your old README or config, it is worth adding because the code supports it. |

| `SESSION_ORPHAN_QUEUE_INITIAL_CAPACITY` | auto | derived internally | Initial orphan/control queue sizing is derived automatically from server worker counts and batching pressure. |
| `STREAM_QUEUE_INITIAL_CAPACITY` | auto | derived internally | Per-stream queue initial capacity is derived automatically from ARQ window size and packing pressure. |
| `DNS_FRAGMENT_STORE_CAPACITY` | auto | derived internally | DNS tunnel fragment store capacity is derived automatically from request concurrency and worker count. |
| `SOCKS5_FRAGMENT_STORE_CAPACITY` | auto | derived internally | SOCKS5 setup fragment store capacity is derived automatically from deferred-session pressure and concurrency. |

| `TERMINAL_STREAM_RETENTION_SECONDS` | `45.0` | clamp to `1..86400` seconds | How long terminal streams remain before final sweeping. |

### 3.5.9) 🪵 Logging

| Parameter | Sample Value | Allowed Values / Real Behavior | Full Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `"INFO"` | usually `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR` | Server log level.<br>For normal production usage, `INFO` is usually enough.<br>For deep investigation of sessions, deferred workers, or ARQ behavior, temporarily use `DEBUG`. |

### 3.5.10) Session Policy Sync

During `SESSION_INIT`, the server may append a compact policy block to `SESSION_ACCEPT`.
The client applies these limits immediately before normal runtime starts.

- Server-enforced `max` values reduce the client only when the requested value is higher.
- Server-enforced `min` values raise the client only when the requested value is lower.
- MTU limits are enforced on both sides:
  - The server clamps the accepted session MTU during init.
  - The client also clamps its local runtime settings after decode.
- Runtime-derived state such as worker counts, queues, fragment stores, and packed-block sizing is rebuilt from the effective synced values.
- Legacy servers that still send the old 7-byte `SESSION_ACCEPT` payload remain compatible; policy sync is simply skipped.

## Section 3.6: 🧪 Testing, Finding, and Scanning Resolvers

Finding suitable resolvers is one of the most important parts of any DNS tunnel project. In this project, the client can automatically find healthy resolvers and test their MTU.
You can use this client feature to discover healthy resolvers, test your own resolvers, or scan resolver ranges.
Just place all IPs line by line into `client_resolvers.txt`.

Then back up your current `client_config.toml`, open it with a text editor, and replace the following values with these suggested ones:

- Lower the MTU ceiling so you find all servers that really behave as DNS servers, and make Min and Max equal to speed up scanning by avoiding automatic binary-search style probing.

```toml
MIN_UPLOAD_MTU=30
MIN_DOWNLOAD_MTU=40
MAX_UPLOAD_MTU=30
MAX_DOWNLOAD_MTU=40
```

- Increase the number of parallel resolver checks:

```toml
MTU_TEST_PARALLELISM = 200
```

- Save healthy resolver results into a text file for later review:

```toml
SAVE_MTU_SERVERS_TO_FILE = true
```

- Change the output format so only the IP is written, which is easier to reuse:

```toml
MTU_SERVERS_FILE_FORMAT = "{IP}"
```

- Reduce retries and timeout to speed up the scan. With these settings you may miss some slightly slower but still healthy resolvers, so increase them if you want more accurate results.

```toml
MTU_TEST_RETRIES = 1
MTU_TEST_TIMEOUT = 1.0
```

> ⚠️ **Important note:** You must already have a server running and must place its key and domain into `client_config.toml` before doing this. Otherwise the client cannot perform MTU tests correctly and will likely mark all resolvers invalid.

Now run the program and wait for the tests to finish. After the process completes, close the program. You will find the saved resolver list in a new `.txt` file next to the main file, and you can then use it as your new `client_resolvers.txt`.

After that, return to your previous settings and use the healthy resolvers you discovered for the best performance.

## Section 3.7: ⚡ Better MTU Understanding and Practical Fast Tuning

This project depends heavily on a suitable MTU. If you set the MTU too high:

- more resolvers fail
- startup becomes longer
- fragmentation and loss increase

If you set it too low:

- speed decreases
- but stability improves

### Practical suggestion

1. Start with the sample config.
2. Let the client test resolvers.
3. Review the MTU results and the number of valid resolvers.
4. If quality is poor, lower `MIN_UPLOAD_MTU` and `MIN_DOWNLOAD_MTU` slightly.
5. If you want faster startup, narrow the `MIN/MAX` MTU range and bring them closer together.

## Section 4: Mobile Usage Guide (Android and iPhone) 📱

Since there is currently no official Android or iOS application published directly by us, you can still use the tunnel on mobile with one of these methods. You can also use Android clients built by other developers that are introduced in Section 5.1.

### Method 1: Share the proxy from your computer 📶

1. Set `LISTEN_IP` to `0.0.0.0`
2. Run the client on your computer
3. Put your phone and computer on the same network
4. Configure a **SOCKS5** proxy on the phone using the computer IP and `LISTEN_PORT`

### Method 2: Run the client on an intermediate server 🏗️

1. Run the main server on the final destination
2. Run the client on an intermediate server
3. Set `LISTEN_IP` to `0.0.0.0`
4. Connect the phone to the SOCKS5 proxy on that intermediate server

### Method 3: Combine it with other panels or services 🛠️

If you already have another panel or service on a server, you can point its outbound path to the local SOCKS5 of the MasterDnsVPN client and use it as the exit path.

### ⚠️ Important Security Notes for Mobile

- If `LISTEN_IP = "0.0.0.0"`, enable SOCKS5 authentication or make sure your network is trusted. Otherwise anyone on that network can use your tunnel. Using username/password on Internet-facing SOCKS5 is strongly recommended.
- You can also change the default `LISTEN_PORT` so it is less exposed to automated scans.
- If devices cannot connect, check the system firewall.

### Section 5.2: Fixing Port 53 Already in Use (Linux Server) 🛑

On most Linux distributions, port `53` is already occupied by `systemd-resolved`. If the server does not start:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
```

Set this value:

```text
DNSStubListener=no
```

Then:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
```

> ⚠️ **Important warning:** You cannot run multiple DNS tunnel projects at the same time on the same server on port `53`.

---

### Section 5.3: Integrate with 3X-UI and use as an Outbound in other panels 🧩

You can use the MasterDnsVPN client as a local proxy inside panels such as 3X-UI or any other system that supports local outbound proxies.
Follow these steps:

- Run the MasterDnsVPN client on the same server where your panel is running.
- In 3X-UI, go to **Inbound** and create a new inbound (VLESS/VMess or any protocol you want).
- Open **Xray Configs**, then go to the **Outbound** tab.
- Click **Add Outbound** to create a new outbound.
- Set **Protocol** to **Socks**.
- Choose a tag (for example: `MasterDnsVPN-Out`).
- In **Address**, enter the local IP of the MasterDnsVPN client (usually `127.0.0.1`).
- In **Port**, enter the `LISTEN_PORT` you set in `client_config.toml` (for example `18000`).
- If SOCKS authentication is enabled in MasterDnsVPN, enter the same username/password here.
- Click **Add Outbound** to save it.
- Go to the **Routing Rules** tab and click **Add Rule**.
- In **Inbound Tags**, pick the inbound you created.
- In **Outbound Tags**, select the `MasterDnsVPN-Out` tag.
- Click **Save** and **Restart Xray**.

Now all traffic for that inbound will go through MasterDnsVPN and exit via your DNS tunnel.

## Section 6: 🛠️ System Architecture and How It Works

**MasterDnsVPN** combines Session Multiplexing, Resolver Balancing, Packet Duplication, a custom ARQ layer, and a Deferred Session Runtime on top of UDP/DNS to avoid the usual limitations of ordinary tunnels.

### Section 6.3: 🧠 Core Concepts Used by the System

| Concept | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Session** | One overall connection between client and server |
| **Stream** | One independent logical connection carried inside a session |
| **Resolver Runtime** | Resolver selection, duplication, health tracking, auto-disable, and recheck |
| **ARQ** | Ordering, ACK, retransmission, timeout, and terminal handling |
| **Deferred Session Runtime** | Ordering-sensitive tasks such as setup, DNS query handling, and sensitive packet flows |
| **Packed Control Blocks** | Multiple small ACK or control packets packed into one block |
| **Synced MTU** | The shared MTU chosen across the healthy resolver pool |

## Section 7: ⚙️ Advanced Technical Notes

- ⚡ **Direct connect or external SOCKS5:** If `USE_EXTERNAL_SOCKS5 = false`, the server connects directly to the target. If `true`, it chains through an external SOCKS5 proxy. In general usage you usually do not need an external SOCKS5 server, so this can stay disabled.
- 🧠 **Per-stream resolver failover:** If a stream gets stuck on a weak resolver, its preferred resolver can move to another one.
- 📦 **Repeated packed control blocks:** The server can repeat the last packed control block for extra turns so important ACK/close packets have a better chance to survive on lossy links.
- 🔒 **Server-side key generation:** If `encrypt_key.txt` does not exist, the server creates it during startup.
